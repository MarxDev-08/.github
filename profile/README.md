## 🏢 Overview

Modern organizations increasingly operate with complex digital systems, and communicating these system structures clearly remains a challenge—especially when both technical and non-technical stakeholders are involved.

Recognizing this need, our team is developing an **Intelligent System Architecture Editor** that aims to make system planning, design, and communication more intuitive and accessible.

## 🧠 Concept

Our approach is based on the **Webcomposition Architecture Model (WAM)**, which provides a structured way to represent system components and their interactions. WAM supports both **visual modelling** and **descriptive language**, enabling systematic documentation and improving understanding across diverse audiences.

To further enhance usability and efficiency, we plan to integrate **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into the design process. By combining a **visual editor** with **natural-language-based interactions**, users will be able to build and refine workflows either manually or by describing their system in simple terms.

This integration has the potential to:
- Save time in the modelling process  
- Encourage creativity and experimentation  
- Make system modelling accessible to users with varying technical backgrounds  

## 🚀 Project Stage

This repository represents the **early research, planning, and conceptualization** phase of our startup project. We are laying the foundation for a tool that combines structured modelling principles with modern AI capabilities, with the long-term vision of improving **system architecture practices** in **collaborative and dynamic environments**.
